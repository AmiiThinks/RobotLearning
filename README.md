### Welcome

The Robot Learning Project is an initiative from the University of Alberta with the goal of creating agents to learn arbitrary information about the environment using low-level sensorimotor data. Learning directly from sensorimotor data is fundamental to the creation of robots that can perform complex tasks without human intervention. By using robotic platforms, researchers can address many obstacles that may be difficult to replicate in a simulation, such as the randomness in delays between sensing stimuli and the environment changing because of the robotic agent's actions.

Unfortunately, robotic learning platforms are often difficult to set up because of the hardware challenges that reinforcement learning researchers may not be used to facing. The Robot Learning Project aims to provide a launchpad for researchers to set up their own robotic learning platform, quickly set up experiments, and focus on reinforcement learning research rather than technical difficulties.
