### (Optional) Ad-hoc Networking
Since we don't have a wireless network set up, we use an ad-hoc network originating from the turtlebot netbook. Note: you will not be able to access the internet while connected to this network.

We followed the instructions [here](http://wiki.ros.org/turtlebot/Tutorials/Advanced%20Networking%20Setup#Fallback_to_AdHoc_Networking).

We also created an ad-hoc network using Ubuntu's wireless settings. Go to the Wi-fi menu bar icon and click `Create New Wifi Network...`. Then choose a network name and security settings. The network should be visible to other computers, which can connect according to the chosen security options.
